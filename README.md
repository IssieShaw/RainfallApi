# Rainfall Api
Converts https://environment.data.gov.uk/flood-monitoring/doc/rainfall (referred to as ExternalAPI) to a template specified in the OpenAPI yaml.

One may find the demonstrator useful to find valid IDs: https://environment.data.gov.uk/flood-monitoring/assets/demo/index.html

Given this is for technical practice only, please launch via the Visual Studio Code Debugger. App/launch settings should be provided. A tab should automatically launch. If not, visit [https://localhost:3000/swagger](https://localhost:3000/swagger/index.html) after starting.
Written in C# / .NET6, this is my first ASP.NET Core Web API practice piece.
